## üî• The Intelligence (How It Works)

### Post-Workout Analysis Algorithm

1. **Calculate Baseline Heart Rate**
   - Takes first 2 minutes (or 20% of workout)
   - Establishes your resting/warmup BPM

2. **Analyze Each Song**
   - Gets all HR data during song
   - Calculates avg/max/min BPM during song
   - Compares to previous 30 seconds
   - Determines BPM change (delta)

3. **Calculate Hype Score**
   ```python
   if BPM increased:
       hype_score = bpm_change

       if during peak workout:
           hype_score *= 1.5  # Bonus!

       if reached high BPM (160+):
           hype_score *= 1.2  # Extra bonus!
   ```

4. **Calculate Cooldown Score**
   ```python
   if BPM decreased:
       cooldown_score = abs(bpm_change)

       if during cooldown period:
           cooldown_score *= 1.5  # Bonus!

       if effective recovery (10+ BPM drop):
           cooldown_score *= 1.2  # Extra bonus!
   ```

5. **Update Personal Stats**
   - Running average of BPM response to each song
   - Tracks how many times you've played it
   - Your unique physiological response!
